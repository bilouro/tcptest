use the last version of pcs
create connection establishment options test

Think about:
    to be able make synchronous tests, will be wonderful remotely
    connect via pcap. eg. thatsideoutput = pcs.PcapConnector(remote,"ed0")  

    self.output = { self.thisside : pcs.PcapConnector("ed0") , \
                    self.thatside : pcs.PcapConnector(remoteip,"ed0") } 

    test this.packet == that.packet will be possible

Think about:
    self.ethersrc = ethernet.ether_atob("00:1c:42:47:3f:cd") 
    It should be automatic
      * may be extend Ethernet to receive ip as constructor arg
	  ethernet( ip ) 
      * may be as a utility method
	  ethernet().configue(ip)     

Rewrite method that receives data from socket, with timeout. For some tests we have to listen for a packet only to certify the DUT doesn't send anything back.
